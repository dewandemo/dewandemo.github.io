👋🏽 Hello! I’m Dewan - a Developer Advocate at Red Hat focusing on cloud-native projects. Before starting at Red Hat, I have worked at IBM for six years as a developer, QA lead, consultant and developer advocate. And even before that, I was a renewable energy engineer designing solar homes for off-grid parts of Bangladesh. 

Enough about work! Besides work, I offer career coaching to students, newgrads and professionals who are trying to transition to the software industry. This site serves my blog, where I share my technical experience, articles on career as well as some random thoughts. 

When I’m not working, I spend quality time with my wife and toddler 👨‍👩‍👦 and play 🎱.
